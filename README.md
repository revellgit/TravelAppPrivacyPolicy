This app uses Google Firebase for the login and register features.

The app uses internet permissions required for login and register to gain access to the application features.

The app is published to Google Play Store as a course requirement for my role as a student studying mobile application development. 

Other than the above, I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences, theme, etc.) created by the the user is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.
